For an analysis on the entire text we can simply use something like what we did in class...

grep -o -i -E "(darkness|destruction|dissolution|dying|extermination|grave|kill|murder|necrosis|rage|ruin|slay|slew|tomb|trouble \
    being|birth|beautiful|born|essence|growth|heart|joyful|life|soul|sparkle|spirit|vigor|vitality|zest)" \
    Grimm_Fairy_Tale.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -r >> count.txt

The results are 

130 beautiful
104 heart
 66 kill
 42 life
 18 Life
 17 rage
 12 murder
 10 spirit
 10 grave
 10 born
  6 joyful
  6 birth
  5 sparkle
  4 soul
  4 darkness
  2 LIFE
  2 HEART
  1 slew
  1 slay
  1 ruin
  1 dying
  1 Murder

For an analysis on every story I tried two different approaches to solving this problem. With the first I wanted to use only the commands we discussed but I just couldnt get it right. 
From the start I knew I needed to cut parts of the file that were not apart of the story. I could have used head and tail but I opted for `sed` which 
can delete ranges of lines...


sed '1,120d' Grimm_Fairy_Tale.txt | sed '9117,9512d' > refinedText.txt


For the first approach I used three seperate `grep` commands to grab every occurence of grim, cheery, and the story occurences along with
line numbers and sorted them.


____
grep -o -n -E \
"(THE GOLDEN BIRD|HANS IN LUCK|...)" \
refinedText.txt| awk -F':' '{print $1 ":" "!" $2 ":"}' > stories.txt

grep -o -n -i -E \
"(darkness|destruction|dissolution|dying|extermination|grave|kill|murder|necrosis|rage|ruin|slay|slew|tomb|trouble)" \
refinedText.txt| awk '{print $0 ","}' > grim.txt

grep -o -n -i -E \
"(being|birth|beautiful|born|essence|growth|heart|joyful|life|soul|sparkle|spirit|vigor|vitality|zest)" \
refinedText.txt | awk '{print $0 ","}' > cheer.txt

cat stories.txt grim.txt cheer.txt| sort -n | cut -d ':' -f 2- | tr -d '\n' | tr '!' '\n' | sed 's/,$//' > results.txt
____

I was attempting to build a sort of csv with STORY:LIST OF WORDS as the format. The first grep built stories.txt formatted as...

1:!THE GOLDEN BIRD:
210:!HANS IN LUCK:

... the idea being that 1 was the line number, then we had the name of the story. `awk` helped me work with the colon added by the -n flag in grep for the line number. 
I could seperate and add what I needed to. The exclamation point later helped me know where to start a newline. I had to seperate this grep from the others because I 
did not need the -i flag. I wanted only those occurrences that were capitilized.

The next two greps built grim and cheer.txt. I could use the -i flag with these to get all occurrences regardless of capitilization. 
Line numbers were also added and `awk` again helped me to add a comma after every word...

4:beautiful,
32:beautiful,
59:life,
160:kill,
192:kill,
202:kill,

Combining and sorting all of the files I got something like this...

1:!THE GOLDEN BIRD:
4:beautiful,
32:beautiful,
59:life,
71:beautiful,
108:beautiful,
144:beautiful,
145:joyful,
160:kill,
192:kill,
202:kill,
210:!HANS IN LUCK:
213:born,
221:being,
241:trouble,
242:heart,
274:heart,
297:trouble,
307:kill,
332:grave,
341:born,
346:trouble,
353:beautiful,
370:beautiful,
387:heart,
388:born,
388:sparkle,
408:heart,
408:trouble,
415:!JORINDA AND JORINDEL:

... a sorted list of where the words occured along with the stories. After some work with `sed`, `tr`, and `cut` I had the file formatted like so...


THE GOLDEN BIRD:beautiful,beautiful,life,beautiful,beautiful,beautiful,joyful,kill,kill,kill
HANS IN LUCK:born,being,trouble,heart,heart,trouble,kill,grave,born,trouble,beautiful,beautiful,heart,born,sparkle,heart,trouble
JORINDA AND JORINDEL:beautiful,beautiful,beautiful,beautiful,rage,beautiful,beautiful
THE TRAVELLING MUSICIANS:spirit,life,spirit,heart,being,heart
OLD SULTAN:kill,trouble,heart

From here I just couldnt figure out how I would get a count of the words that occurred in each story as I would need to `uniq` and `sort` every line individually starting after the colon. 
I think `awk` could have done it but I couldnt make it work.

My next approach created an array of line numbers where the stories started and ended. From there I could loop over the array and grab the text for the specific story, 
applying `grep` to search for the cheery and grim words. I found one occurence of an uppercase RUMPELSTILTSKIN that I had to account for with `sed`. The entire script was...

# Read numbers from file into the array

    lineNumberArray+=("$line")

    next=$((i + 1))

        nextNumber="${lineNumberArray[next]}"
        story=$(sed -n "${current},${nextNumber}p" refinedText.txt)
        sed -n "${current}p" refinedText.txt >> count.txt

    fi
done

The loop runs over a list of the line numbers that the storys start on and where the next begins. I had to set up an if statement to catch if we were at the last index. `sed` helped me get the
each story by the line numbers. It also helped me print a header for the story. From there I could use two `grep` commands to seperate and sort the cheery words and the grim words. I had to use >>
in order to append to the file and not overwrite every iteration.

At first my grep command looked like so...

grep -o -i -E "(being|birth|beautiful|born|essence|growth|heart|joyful|life|soul|sparkle|spirit|vigor|vitality|zest)" <<< $story | uniq -c | sort -r >> count.txt

... but my output wasnt coming back correct. I had situations like so

THE GOLDEN BIRD
	---Grim Words---
   3 kill
	---Cheery Words---
   3 beautiful
   2 beautiful
   1 life
   1 joyful

beautiful should be combined but wasnt. To fix I had to sort twice with what is above
